## Data Issues

- Data
- Data quality
- Not enough data
- Too much data

## Model Issues

- How good is the model
- What can go wrong
- Avoid learning things that are not true
- Patterns may not represent any underlying rule
- Actionable, Trivial or Surprising
- Learning things that are true but not useful
- Are we overfitting
- Training data does not reflext the relevant population
